                  Similarly, if Applicable Law requires that a purchaser’s identity be verified, you must verify the purchaser’s
                  identity. We will not be responsible for your failure to adequately verify your purchasers’ identities
                  or qualifications.

                  To create an invoice, you may post a request to Cubits to collect a specific amount in your
                  local currency, such as sterling or euros, or in bitcoin. Cubits will pull the exchange rate
                  and provide the bitcoin payment instructions to the purchaser. We guarantee the exchange rate
                  to you as long as the purchaser pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created.
                  While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the purchaser pays within such time window,
                  you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or bitcoin, as applicable.
                  For instance, if you ask us to collect £150, and the purchaser sends the payment within the time window,
                  we guarantee you will receive exactly £150, minus our fee, but do not guarantee the value of sterling.

                  When you customer pays your invoice for for your goods/services, we will receive the bitcoins
                  and exchange them into fiat. After we have withdrawn our fees from the transaction amount,
                  we will remit the fiat currency to the bank account that you have designated on your application form.
                  We bear no responsibility for the funds not reaching you due to you not providing us with correct
                  bank account details. The settlement of fiat to your bank account should be done as soon as reasonably
                  possible, we estimate 24-48 hours settlement although we do not guarantee a time frame due
                  to this being dependent on the speed of the banks involved and their respective locations.

                  If you proceed with the purchase of bitcoin then the transaction is irreversible.
                  You are able to pay for the bitcoins using a number of methods, of which involves

                  your accounting ledger are funds temporarily held by Cubits until settlement to your
                  bank account can take place. You can receive a settlement in your local currency,
                  in bitcoins, or in a mixture of both. You assume volatility risks of the currency
                  in which you choose to be settled. If you choose to keep bitcoins, then you assume
                  the volatility risk of the bitcoin value.

                  In the event that you wish to issue a refund to a purchaser, Cubits can handle this.
                  You can decide to issue a partial refund or the full amount of the initial purchase.
                  You can also decide whether to issue the original amount of the invoice in your local
                  currency or in the number of bitcoins paid. If you do not have enough funds in your
                  Cubits account to cover the refund, Cubits may require you to deposit bitcoins into
                  your Cubits account to cover the refund to the purchaser. Any required currency
                  conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate available
                  at the time. Under no circumstances do we guarantee a refund of bitcoin at the
                  same price at which the bitcoins were originally exchanged for with the Merchant.
