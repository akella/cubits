                <p>
                  User security is one of our top priorities. All of our users' Bitcoin
                  are stored offline, in <a href="#">deep cold storage</a>, where they are inaccessible
                  to internet-based attacks. Any online funds are Cubits' own Bitcoin, meaning
                  that in the unlikely event of an attack all lost funds will be Cubits' own.
                  Furthermore, all transactions are <a href="#">multi-signature</a>, which decreases
                  your risk of fraudulent spending. Finally, users can enable two-factor
                  authentication to further decrease the chance of someone else
                  accessing their wallet.
