        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a <a href="#">decentralised</a>,  <a href="#">open-source</a> payment
            system made possible by decades of innovation in computer science. With Bitcoin,
            users can send money directly to one another, without the use of a third party
            and with fees totalling less than a few cents - all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As digital currency, Bitcoin don't physically exist – they are actually numeric
            codes secured by layers of <a href="#">cryptography</a> and stored on your computer.
            Each individual Bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 individual increments,
            called Satoshis. As of 2015, there are over 14 million Bitcoin in circulation.
            <a href="#">Only 21 million will ever be mined</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin's intangibility is perhaps best compared to the credit or debit card data
            you provide to online merchants when making purchases over the internet.
            Just as with the money on your card, you don't physically hold the cash.
            Unlike credit cards, there is no bank to deal with, no plastic to keep,
            and it can't be stolen just by somebody knowing the numbers on your card.
            
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="title title_mrgtop"><b>Who controls Bitcoin?</b></h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Bitcoin and its payment processes are not controlled by any central authority.
            As a result, no single institution can exert control over the payment system
            as is the case with government-controlled banking systems. This prevents users
            from exposure to risks associated with fiat currencies like <a href="#">hyperinflation</a>,
            <a href="#">deflation</a> and more. Additionally, Bitcoin's structure and design makes the
            previously unimaginable possible: transactions are instantly completed, and there
            are no exploitative bank fees attached to your purchase.

                <p>
                  Unlike with traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled
                  by a Central Bank or a third party. The network does not
                  provide any actor with an unfair advantage.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="benefits__item"><strong>Simplicity</strong>
                <p>
                  Transferring Bitcoin to another part of the world requires only
                  an internet connection and wallet application. Traditional bank transfers
                  require excessive documentation and jumping through hoops.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="benefits__item"><strong>Speed</strong>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin transactions can reach other parts of the world in
                  matter of seconds. Bitcoin is for finance is what email was for postal
                  industry: an infinitely cheaper and more efficient alternative.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="benefits__item"><strong>Low Cost</strong>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin transaction fees are minuscule compared to regular banking
                  transaction fees. With Bitcoin, users don't have to pay any financial
                  institution. Fees for transactions of any size are about $0.02,
                  and are directed to the miners who help keep Bitcoin secure.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="benefits__item"><strong>Transparency</strong>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin transactions are stored in the blockchain, a public ledger,
                  which is distributed across the Internet. This means that transaction
                  records are freely accessible, and that anyone can look up Bitcoin
                  transaction histories, addresses and mining results.

            <p>
              The price of Bitcoin is freely formed on online marketplaces.
              Marketplaces provide buyers and sellers with a place to interface
              and exchange Bitcoin for an agreed upon price. At any point, the
              supply and demand of Bitcoin can move the price up or down.
              Cubits connects with several marketplaces to try and find
              the best price for its users. Read more about how we calculate
              the price for our Bitcoin exchanges <a href="#">here</a>

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Currently, the technology required to hack the Bitcoin network doesn't exist.
              To do so, hackers would need to access to massive amounts of computer power,
              or to find a way to decode the complex cryptography that secures Bitcoin.
              Presently, neither of these scenarios are plausible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your wallet or exchange service, however, can be hacked. This is why it is
              important to choose a wallet or exchange service with high security standards.
              At Cubits, we secure 100% of our customers' Bitcoin in <a href="#">deep cold storage</a>
              and secure all transactions with <a href="#">multi signature</a> technology.

                    The Bitcoin network does not store or require any of your personal data,

                    cryptographic SHA-256 protocol. The network also relies on decentralised
                    consensus, which means that there is no single point of failure or weak
                    link that can compromise the network. Additionally, a team of programmers
                    is always working on refining and improving the code, and all modifications
                    are publicly submitted for a consensus agreement.

                    A Bitcoin wallet is an application that interfaces with the Bitcoin

                    purposes are all the same: they enable you to receive, store and send

              The blockchain is a distributed database that holds a transaction
              ledger containing every verified Bitcoin transaction ever completed.
              Each entry contains three parts: the sender's address, the receiver's
              address and the amount of Bitcoin sent. The blockchain is being
              continuously updated to show new transactions.

              A Bitcoin private key is attached to a user's public address and

              proves to the network that you own the Bitcoin you are sending &mdash;
              it is similar to a password, so be sure to keep your private key safe.

                  generated from your private key. Your wallet address will function like a postal
                  address: anyone who knows your address will be able to send you Bitcoin.
